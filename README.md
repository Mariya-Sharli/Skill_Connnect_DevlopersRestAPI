# Skill_Connnect_DevlopersRestAPI

### 🧠 Concept:

A backend API that lets developers create and manage their portfolio profiles, including their skills, projects, and experience.

This project demonstrates how a single developer can have multiple skills, projects, and experiences — all connected through bi-directional relationships in JPA (One-to-Many & Many-to-One).
